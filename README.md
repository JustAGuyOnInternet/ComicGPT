All mentees have documented in [this](https://www.notion.so/ComicGPT-ec6d472d1e264ad9b74d6f08a03b429d) notion page. 
This is my section of [key learnings](https://www.notion.so/Aditya-Vibhute-84f409d2f2084b2984d79abbcbe4ae4d) from the above notion page.<br />
This project was based on the key concept of machine learning. We analysed many diffferent image generative models such as stable diffusion v1.5, LoRA, Dall-E, Lexica, etc.  We also learnt how to generate a database for an image generation software. We also used many different open-source models from civitai.<br />
In the end, we made two image generative models. One, using chatGPT API and stable diffusion v1.5 to generate a story based on a key sentece given by user and another using chataGPT API and LoRA trained civitai models to generate story. These models generate 10 different prompts which the code passes it thorugh the image generation model and the end results are displayed.
